                            sustainability and animal welfare concerns, and rejoined the family
                            business with a renewed vision – to build a truly integrated Indian
                            enterprise. Depots were established at Sealdah and Ultadanga marking the
                            group’s first rail-linked logistics advantage through operations with
                            Northeast Frontier Railway and Eastern Railway.
